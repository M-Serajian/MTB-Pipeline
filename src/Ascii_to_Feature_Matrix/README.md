This code is designed to transform the Ascii file generated by SBWT in the previous section to the feature matrix usable for training a classifier. 

# Usage
```bash
python Ascii_to_Matrix.py 

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -1 ARG1     file_number
  -2 ARG2     Number of Samples (Fasta files)
  -3 ARG3     Color matrix address (output of SBWT)
  -4 ARG4     Desired directory to save .npy files
  -5 ARG5     Number of kmers in each file
  -6 ARG6     min number of occurance for filteration
  -7 ARG7     max number of occurance for filteration
```
